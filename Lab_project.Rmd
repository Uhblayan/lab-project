# Filter records for species Pig
pig_records <- filter(seattlepets, species == "Pig")

# Arrange the filtered records by pet names (animal_name)
sorted_pig_records <- arrange(pig_records, animal_name)

# Display the sorted pig records
sorted_pig_records
```
Write your narrative here
Filtering Records for Species Pig:
pig_records <- filter(seattlepets, species == "Pig"): Filters the records in the seattlepets dataset to only include those where the species is “Pig”.
The filter() function selects rows from the dataset where the condition species == "Pig" is met.
It creates a subset of the dataset containing only records for pigs.
The filtered records are stored in the variable pig_records.
Arranging Filtered Records by Pet Names:
sorted_pig_records <- arrange(pig_records, animal_name): Arranges the filtered pig records by pet names (animal_name) in ascending order.
The arrange() function sorts the rows of the dataset based on the specified column, which in this case is animal_name

# Select only pet name (animal_name) and primary breed for species Goat
goat_records <- select(filter(seattlepets, species == "Goat"), animal_name, primary_breed)

# Arrange the selected records by pet names (animal_name)
sorted_goat_records <- arrange(goat_records, animal_name)

# Display the sorted goat records
sorted_goat_records
```
Write your narrative here
Selecting Pet Name and Primary Breed for Species Goat:
goat_records <- select(filter(seattlepets, species == "Goat"), animal_name, primary_breed): Selects only the columns animal_name and primary_breed from the seattlepets dataset for records where the species is “Goat”.
The filter() function is used to subset the dataset to include only records where the species is “Goat”.
The select() function then selects the specified columns (animal_name and primary_breed) from the filtered dataset.
The selected records are stored in the variable goat_records.

Loading the Required Library:
library(ggplot2): Loads the ggplot2 library, which provides functions for creating data visualizations.
Creating a Bar Plot of Species Counts:
species_plot <- ggplot(seattlepets, aes(x = species)) + geom_bar() + labs(title = "Counts of Species", x = "Species", y = "Count") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)):
ggplot() initializes a new ggplot object.
seattlepets specifies the dataset to be used.
aes(x = species) maps the x-axis to the “species” column in the dataset.
geom_bar() creates a bar plot where the height of each bar represents the count of occurrences of each species.
labs() sets the title and axis labels for the plot.

`a.	What does the above code chunk do?

This code defines a vector top_10_names that contains the 10 most common pet names identified in Task 4. This list will be used to filter and analyze the dataset for these specific pet names

`b. Plot the counts of the pet names (animal_name) in top_10_names
```{r}
top_10_names <- seattlepets %>% 
filter(animal_name %in% c( "Lucy"  , "Charlie" , "Luna" , "Bella" , "Max"    ,

```
The relationship between the proportion of cats with a given name and the proportion of dogs with the same name is negative. In the context of the data, this negative relationship means that as the proportion of cats with a given name increases, the proportion of dogs with the same name tends to decrease, and vice versa. This suggests an inverse relationship in the popularity of names between cats and dogs in the dataset

`10.  (2 points)

`The below code plots the proportion of dogs with a given name versus the proportion of cats with the same name. The 20 most common cat and dog names are displayed. The diagonal line on the plot is the x = y line; if a name appeared on this line, the name’s popularity would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.

`What names are more common for cats than dogs? The ones above the line or the ones below the line?

`Answer here....The names that are more common for cats than dogs are the ones above the diagonal line (x = y) on the plot.



`Is the relationship between the two variables (proportion of cats with a given name and proportion of dogs with a given name) positive or negative? What does this mean in context of the data?

`Answer here .....The relationship between the proportion of cats with a given name and the proportion of dogs with the same name is negative. In the context of the data, this negative relationship means that as the proportion of cats with a given name increases, the proportion of dogs with the same name tends to decrease, and vice versa. This suggests an inverse relationship in the popularity of names between cats and dogs in the dataset.
